	  <strong>Vital Education</strong><br>
	  for the development of one’s character. Learning how to build and manage relationships and controlling emotions. The development of faculties for the appreciation of drama, music, arts, sports and the drive for self perfection as an individual.<br><br>
	  
	  <strong>Physical Education</strong><br>
	  for agility, strength, flexibility, team building and collaboration.<br><br>
	  
	  <strong>Spiritual Education</strong><br>
	  for the growth of consciousness from a lower to higher level and for the development of deeper and larger values.<br><br>
