Friends & Family is an acclaimed market-driven cafe and bakery in Los Angeles. At the helm is husband and wife duo, Pastry Chef/Baker Roxana Jullapat and Chef Daniel Matter, who opened Friends & Family after stints in several renowned kitchens of Los Angeles — including AOC, Lucques, Campanile and Cooks County. Their new website is simplistic, yet refined. Beautiful imagery of scrumptious pastries and tempting deli items entice hungry visitors. The prominent “Order Now” button in the navigation bar helpfully instructs visitors how to place orders for pickup and delivery — all without leaving the website.

 It is a suitable place to sit with a cup of tea or coffee or to spend spare time with your friends. In my humble opinion, it would be hard to find friendlier place in Murom than this litlle café, but of course it is a matter of taste.
 </p>

<p>
This coffee-house is located in Moscovskaya street near the café-club “Happiness”. The interior helps to create relaxed home atmosphere. It is a small café, which specializes in serving coffee and desserts with a small and simple dining room. You can find different types of coffee there - espresso, capuchino, latte, black coffee, coffee with cognac, liqueur and some others.
</p>

<p>
Also this café provides all kinds of drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic, such as juice, mineral water and various types of tea. The café’s menu is rather diverse. You can eat salads, fish and meat dishes; tasty cakes, rolls and and pies with different fillings; fruits - apples, oranges, grapefruits and lemons cut in small pieces; sandwiches and pancakes with various syrops and sauces; sushi and a variety of ice-cream, that can be with fruit sweet syrops, nuts and chocolate.
</p>

<p>
The interior of this café is rather cosy and comfortable. Inside the café one can observe several small wooden tables without table-cloths, wooden chairs and nice soft sofas. There are stands with sugar, salt and paper napkins on the tables. Near the entrance, there is a large mirror, therefore the visitors have an opportunity to look at themselves.
Along the walls are wooden cases with some pictures and photos.You can always hear unostentatious and melodic music there.

I really like the atmosphere, good coffee, and nice interior. This is a good place to study or chill with friends. The drinks and foods were all tasty and worthwhile. If you’re up for a fresh place with beautiful architecture then this is a must to visit.

This place is amazing! They offered the best coffee and showed the best attitude to its costumers. Internet connection is very fast and is unlimited as well. This place is indeed perfect for studying and chilling out. It was very quiet and air-conditioned. I just want to keep coming back to this place. Thank you!
